# OpenNMS Horizon BPG  monitoring 

## Background 
Create a tutorial showing how OpenNMS can be configured to monitor BGP in a simulated "Internet Exchange”. Provide a working instance of OpenNMS deployed against a small scale BPG network using both soft and hard routers.


 Our team has been asked to produce documentation and video tutorial materials for OpenNMS for the purpose of a University project. We will be focusing on the following areas:
- Deployment and configuration of OpenNMS against a working BGP network showcasing its ability to detect a variety of failures and subsequent alerts
- Using software and bare metal routing to configure a BGP network.​
 -Provide repeatable and version-controlled configurations accessible within a shared GitHub repository.​.

This will Provide indistry professionals an enviorment to test and view a working small scale  BGP topology in the form of software and hardware routers plus a monitoring slotion useing OpenNMS
